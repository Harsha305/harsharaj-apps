  <h1>Privacy Policy for Sigma Tutor</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 13, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the Sigma Tutor app ("we", "our", or "the app") handles user information. By using the app, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.</p>

  <h2>1. No Collection of Personal Information</h2>
  <p>The Sigma Tutor app operates entirely on your local device. It does not require or maintain a user account, and it does not collect, transmit, or store any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, or contact details.</p>

  <h2>2. No Analytics or Tracking</h2>
  <p>The app does not include any third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking technologies. No usage data or behavioral information is transmitted to external servers by the app itself.</p>

  <h2>3. YouTube API Privacy Notice</h2>
  <p>The app allows users to query the YouTube Data API using their own personal API key. These queries are limited to course-related concepts and subtopics relevant to the user's learning path. The app does not store or transmit these keys or queries to any server under our control.</p>
  <p>Users are solely responsible for reviewing and agreeing to the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">YouTube (Google) Privacy Policy</a> when obtaining and using their API keys. We do not monitor, store, or share any data related to your use of the YouTube API.</p>
  <p>The app also makes a one-time call to Google servers to retrieve the current time. This is used to adjust the app’s internal settings and is not stored, tracked, or linked to your identity.</p>

  <h2>4. OpenRouter AI Model Usage and Privacy Notice</h2>
  <p>The app allows interaction with OpenRouter's AI models using your personal OpenRouter API key. Prompts sent to OpenRouter may include your study topics, learning goals, background knowledge, and links to videos you have selected within the app.</p>
  <p>These prompts are transmitted directly to OpenRouter from your device. The app does not store or retain your prompts or API keys. Please refer to <a href="https://openrouter.ai/privacy">OpenRouter’s Privacy Policy</a> to understand how your information is handled on their systems.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>All educational content, progress, and configuration settings are stored locally on your device. No data is uploaded to any server controlled by the developer of Sigma Tutor.</p>

  <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>This app is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal data through this app, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, you may contact us via the in-app support feature, which sends an email directly to our support team.</p>
