  <h1>Privacy Policy for Sigma Tutor</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 13, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the Sigma Tutor app ("we", "our", or "the app") handles user information. By using the app, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.</p>

  <h2>1. No Collection of Personal Information</h2>
  <p>The Sigma Tutor app operates entirely on the user's local device. It does not require or maintain a user account, and it does not transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) to a backend server.</p>

  <h2>3. No In-App Analytics or Behavioral Tracking</h2>
  <p>The app does not include any third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking technologies.</p>
  <p>However, when the app is installed from the Google Play Store, Google may automatically collect anonymized crash reports and performance data (such as ANRs or battery usage) through its Android Vitals system. This data is made available to the developer via the Play Console solely to improve app stability and performance. For more details, see the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p>


  <h2>3. YouTube API Privacy Notice</h2>
  <p>The app queries the YouTube Data API using the user's own API key. These queries include course-related concepts and subtopics relevant to the user's learning path. The app does not transmit these keys or queries to any server under our control.</p>
  <p>Users are solely responsible for reviewing and agreeing to the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">YouTube (Google) Privacy Policy</a> when obtaining and using their API keys. We do not monitor, store, or share any data related to your use of the YouTube API.</p>
  <p>The app also makes a one-time call to Google servers to retrieve the current time. This is used to adjust the app’s internal settings and is not stored, tracked, or linked to your identity.</p>

  <h2>4. OpenRouter AI Model Usage and Privacy Notice</h2>
  <p>The app queries the user's chosen AI models on OpenRouter using the user's OpenRouter API key. Prompts sent to OpenRouter may include the user's study topics, learning goals, background knowledge, and links to relevant YouTube videos.</p>
  <p>These prompts are transmitted directly to OpenRouter from the user's device. The app does not transmit these keys or queries to any server under our control. Please refer to <a href="https://openrouter.ai/privacy">OpenRouter’s Privacy Policy</a> to understand how your data is handled on their systems.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>All educational content, progress, and configuration settings are stored locally on the user's device. No data is uploaded to any server under our control.</p>

  <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>This app is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal data through this app, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, you may contact us via the in-app support feature, which sends an email directly to our support team.</p>
